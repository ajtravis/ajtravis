## About Me

Hi, my name is Alex Travis and I am a full stack software engineer with skills including JavaScript, C++, Python, React, SQL, Git, Express, Flask, and SQLAlchemy to name a few. I recently built three fullstack projects using these skills, one with a team of three others and the other two by myself. I attended App Academy, a software engineering bootcamp with and acceptance rate of around 3%, where I spent 80 hours a week sharpening my skills in a project based learning environment.
